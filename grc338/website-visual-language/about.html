            <p>The beginning of Ellie’s started with Ellie and Jim opening this bakery/deli in 1994 to offer a healthy food alternative to local customers and travelers on I-5 and Highway 97. It started out as a small single room cafe and slowly expanded when The Hagarty family took over the business in 2011. This included adding the Internet cafe, increasing the dining area, adding a Wine Bar, and live music in 2015. In July of 2018, Ellie’s was taken over by the West family. The West family have been locals and part of the community dating back to 1969 and plan to keep the tradition of Ellie’s going for many years to come. Serving up homemade goodies and a comfortable homey place to relax and enjoy your cup of coffee.</p>
